# Machine Learning of Public Sentiments toward Wind Energy in Norway 

This repository contains scripts and data for the project 'Machine Learning of Public Sentimentes toward Wind Energy in Norway', primarily post-processing of the results, for figures and analysis. The main pre-processing code is hosted by [Andebraa](https://github.com/andebraa/wind_power_analysis).

The project is organised at the University of Oslo with researchers from The Department of Technology Systems (ITS), The Department of Mathematics, Department of Informatics (IFI) and Department of Media and Communications. 

The main goal of the project is to explore new methods for attaining information on public sentiment towards wind energy and the results are available as a pre-print on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02388).
